# Development

## Android Code

Flat is an app that attempts to use the latest cutting edge libraries and tools. As a summary:

* Entirely written in Kotlin.
* UI Mostly written in Jetpack Compose (see below).
* Uses Kotlin Coroutines throughout.
* Uses many of the Architecture Components, including: Room, Lifecycle, ViewModel.
* Uses Hilt for dependency injection

## Development Tool

Flat require the latest Android Studio Arctic Fox release to be able to build the app. This is
because the project is written in Jetpack Compose (more on that below).
